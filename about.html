            <img src="golu.jpg" alt="golu.jpg" class="img"> I am a Front-end Developer with 1 years of experience, and
            student of BCA . I create successful websites
            that
            are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices.

            I work to make a better web; one that is fast, easy to use, beautiful, accessible to all, and
            frustration-free.
            Regardless of your specific business requirements, in solving these challenges, you have a great chance of
            finding success online.

            My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a passion for design. Given that producing a
            modern website requires the combination of design, server technology, and the layer that users interacts
            with, I
            believe having experience in both design and development allows for making the most optimal user
            experiences.

            My clients have found that hiring me has saved them time and money, made it easier to grow their website
            alongside their business, and made for a product that is consistently of high quality.

            <div class="left">
                <h2 class="h2">Front-end Developer</h2>
                <p>I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce responsive websites and web apps that provide users
                    the best
                    and
                    most appropriate experience suited to their device and browser.</p><br>
                <p>I write standards based code that is semantic, accessible, search-engine friendly, easy to
                    maintain,
                    cross browser compatible, and performant.</p>
                <p>Building a future-proof and easy-to-maintain website is achieved by breaking down a web page into
                    its smallest pieces, often called components, and building them in a way that exists outside the
                    context of the design they first appear in. This allows for components that can be re-used in
                    other areas of a website as it grows and makes the intention easier for other developers to
                    understand and test. Wherever possible, I find it valuable to create a style guide (using
                    Storybook for example) that acts as a document for a reusable and maintainable code base. All
                    involved in a project can rely on a style guide to understand a project’s language and produce a
                    more consistent user experience. Re-usable components make for a website that can quickly grow
                    as does your business.</p>
                <p>
                    I am also experienced in building systems that implement business logic and interact with
                    server-side technology via APIs and tools such as React and Redux, as well as testing code using
                    tools such as Jasmine.

                    I have a special interest in use of animation on the web. I particularly like working on
                    websites that have seamless transitions and require high-level performance to maintain a smooth
                    and appealing website.
